# stack-based-calculator
Stack-based calculator and its supporting data structures, programmed in C#

This project was created as a short exercise exploring basic data structures. The calculator allows for four basic operations, exponentiation, and parentheses. This command-line program parses the user input then uses Dijkstra's Shunting-Yard Algorithm to convert it into Reverse Polish Notation. The program uses an array-based stack to evaulate the expression, and additionally uses an array-based dictionary.
